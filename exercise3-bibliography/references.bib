  abstract = {Few concepts are more central to the analysis of democratic politics than public opinion. It is, or seems to be, a completely familiar idea, simply part of the landscape of politics we take for granted today. Yet to the specialist, getting a grip on public opinion is not that easy. Public opinion is, as Converse (I 975) once put it, \&quot;impalpable,\&quot; \&quot;amorphous ,\&quot; and {$\cdot\&\#$}39;mercurial\&quot; (p . 77). Public opinion is hard to pin down. Conceding that my subject is complicated and difficult, I nevertheless hope to say something systematic and intelligible about it here. My particular topic is public opinion, but the chapter can be read more broadly as another installment in the continuing conversation between political science and social psychology. This conversation began, one could say, just after the tum of the century with publication of Graham Wallas \&\#39;s Human Nature in Politics (1908), and it has been carried on over the decades by Harold Lasswell (1930) , Solomon Asch (1987), Carl Hovland (1959) , Robert Lane (1959a , 1973), David Sears (1969), Philip Converse (1970) , Herbert Simon (1985), and William McGuire (1993), among others. Following in these large footsteps, and now nearing the end of the twentieth century, I take up here a series of political topics-the competence of citizens , the ingredients of opinion, the power of social context and political discussion , the translation of},

  abstract = {The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion synthesizes leading studies of public opinion from the late 1980s in a top-down model of opinion formation and change. The core feature of this synthesis, the Receive-AcceptSample (RAS) model, remains sound, but the book overstates the importance of the form of public opinion that it explains*elite-induced survey statements of issue positions*and understates the force of opinions that elites cannot easily shape and that citizens may not be able to articulate in response to survey prompts. Moreover, there are major problems in the book's Parable of Purple Land. What, then, becomes of the top-down view of elite-mass interaction outlined in Nature and Origins? To answer this question, I begin by characterizing the kinds of opinions Nature and Origins leaves out: Converse's ``group interest'' voters, ``nature of the times'' voters, and issue publics. I then add a model of political parties as policy-motivated organizers of Converse's voter types. The upshot is an account of elite/mass interactions that is still largely top-down and that has roles for both the elite-led attitudes that the RAS model explains and the less conventional and harder-to-shape attitudes that it overlooks.},

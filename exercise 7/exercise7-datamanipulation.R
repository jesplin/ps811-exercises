# Problem 1: create a dataframe

# create vectors for each column

# Problem 2: justices.csv

# download data and load

# ## can also download data via readr package
# library (readr)
# 
# # assign url object
# urlfile <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcyshieh/ps811/master/data/justices.csv"
# 
# # import dataset via url
# mydata<-read_csv(url(urlfile))



# Problem 3: merge justices.csv and SCDB_2020_01_justiceCentered_Citation.dta

# download dataset and load
scotus_data <- read_dta(here("exercise 7/SCDB_2020_01_justiceCentered_Citation.dta"))

full_data <- inner_join(justice_data, scotus_data, by = "justiceName")

# Problem 4: filter to justices with Martin-Quinn scores

# filter new dataset to look at mq scores

# returns TRUE so I don't think I'm filtering this correctly
## Marcy said this is correct so far


# Ethan sent me his code and I go through it here to solve the rest of the assignment because I got stuck after working on this for 2 hours
# I believe this counts as citing my sources? 


# join dataset (from)

  group_by(term) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(post_mn, na.rm = TRUE))

# print results (from Ethan)
print(mqscore_term, n = nrow(mqscore_term))



# Problem 6: find the mean decision direction for each term and rescale to Martin-Quinn score 

# mutate data so the values work like mq scores (from Ethan)
# noticing that this also follow's Marcy's lecture resource
joined_justices <- mutate(joined_justices,
                          decisionDirection = case_when(

# Problem 7: compare the mean Martin-Quinn scores and vote directions

# compare mq scores and vote direction (from Ethan)
compare_mq_decision <- inner_join(mqscore_term, decision_byterm,
                                  by="term")

# Ethan noted that this results in a new variable that kept NAs

# add column names to new variable to make it easier to understand (from Ethan)
colnames(compare_mq_decision) <- c("term", "MQ Score", "Vote Direction")

# view data (from Ethan)
view(compare_mq_decision)

# plot data to view visual comparison
plot(compare_mq_decision$`MQ Score`, compare_mq_decision$`Vote Direction`)

# The plot shows a pretty good correlation between the decisionDirection variable from the scotus dataset and the Martin-Quinn scores from the justices dataset (linear regression line  between the two)
